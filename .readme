- Viewing all taxpayers
- Checking user-paid and unpaid taxes
- Checking all taxes for a specific user
- Making tax payments
- Retrieving all taxes for all taxpayers

### Local Access (Development)

If you want to run the TaxApp API locally for development or testing purposes, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this Git repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aryankhanna-2002/taxapp.git


   after that just 
   npm install and node app.js 

Authentication and Security
The TaxApp API employs strong security measures, including:

Password Hashing: User passwords are securely hashed and salted using bcrypt to ensure the confidentiality of user data.

Token-Based Authorization: To access protected endpoints, include the Authentication: token xyz header in your Postman requests, replacing xyz with the actual authentication token obtained during login.

Note
The reason for not providing a Docker image is due to an issue related to a C++ code dependency in the bcrypt package. Creating a Docker image with this issue is problematic. If you encounter any issues while setting up the application locally, please feel free to contact me for assistance.
